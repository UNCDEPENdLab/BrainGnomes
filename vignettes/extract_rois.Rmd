# Overview

The `extract_rois()` function -- called via `run_project` -- summarizes postprocessed
BOLD data within atlas‑defined regions and can also compute ROI‑to‑ROI connectivity matrices.
It is run after postprocessing completes and writes its outputs to
the project’s `data_rois` directory. At present, ROI extraction requires that postprocessing
be included in the pipeline because postprocessed files serve as the inputs to ROI extraction.

ROI extraction is enabled during `setup_project()` or `edit_project()`. During the setup, 
you will be asked about how to reduce voxels within ROIs to an aggregated time series and
how to compute correlations among them. Once configured, `run_project()` will schedule extraction jobs.

# ROI extraction setup

During `setup_project`, if you enable ROI extraction, you will be asked to create one or more extraction
streams. These consist of a name (for identifying the stream), the postprocess streams that should serve
as inputs to extraction (i.e., what files from postprocessing should be used), and which atlases or ROI masks
should be used for extraction.

Note that multiple postprocessing streams can serve as inputs for an extraction stream.

Also, multiple atlases/ROI masks can be included in a single extraction stream. As detailed belwo,
the output files are named according to the mask name. All atlas/ROI mask files should be integer-valued
NIfTI files having the same stereotaxic space and spatial resolution as the postprocessed data.
BrainGnomes performs simple checks on these files, but please check these yourself, too!

# ROI reduction methods

Each atlas region contains many voxels. The `roi_reduce` argument controls how
those voxel time series are combined into a single ROI signal:

* **mean** – averages all voxels (default).
* **median** – takes the median to reduce sensitivity to outliers.
* **pca** – extracts the first principal component and aligns its sign with the
  mean, capturing the dominant pattern of variation.
* **huber** – applies a Huber M‑estimator for a robust trimmed mean.

## Removal of missing voxels

Note that ROI extraction removes any constant voxels (e.g., all zero) prior to
calculating the aggregated time series.

## Removal of scrubbed timepoints

If scrubbing was enabled for the relevant postprocessing stream, ROI extraction will then use the
`_censor.1D` file corresponding to each NIfTI. More specifically, any timepoints identified by
the scrubbing expression will be dropped from the timeseries outputs and functional connectivity
calculations.

# Choosing correlation methods

Connectivity matrices are optional and are governed by the `cor_method`
argument. Multiple methods may be supplied. If you choose `'none'`, then
no connectivity calculations will be done. Supported options include:

* **pearson** – standard product–moment correlation.
* **spearman** – rank‑based correlation that is robust to non‑linear but
  monotonic relationships.
* **kendall** – Kendall’s $\tau$ for ordinal or small sample data.
* **cor.shrink** – shrinkage estimator from the `corpcor` package, useful when
  the number of ROIs is large relative to the number of time points.

# Other settings

BrainGnomes can export the time series from each ROI (aggregating voxels in the region)
to a .tsv file that is volumes x rois in size. This can be helpful if you want to run
external analyses on ROI time series. If you answer "yes" to `Output ROI time series?`, then
BrainGnomes will output timeseries files ending in `_timeseries.tsv`.

The `rtoz` flag applies Fisher’s \(z\) (aka `atanh`) transform to correlations, producing
unbounded values better suited for group analysis.

You can also specify the minimum number of voxels that must be present for an ROI to be considered valid.
The default is 5. If an ROI has fewer voxels, then it will be set to NA in the timeseries and connectivity
output files.

# Output files and naming

Outputs are organised by atlas within `data_rois/<atlas_name>/`.  Filenames use
extended BIDS entities: the atlas appears as `rois-<Atlas>` and correlation
methods are labelled `cor-<method>`. For example:

```
sub-01_task-rest_desc-clean_rois-Schaefer400_timeseries.tsv
sub-01_task-rest_desc-clean_rois-Schaefer400_cor-pearson_connectivity.tsv
```

These naming conventions ensure that time‑series and connectivity files can be
matched to their originating runs and analysis choices.


## Note about atlas naming

For a BIDS 'entity' to be valid, it must not contain underscores or hyphens since these
serve as field delimiters in BIDS. Consequently, if your atlas/ROI file contains hyphens
or underscores, these will be removed and the next character will be capitalized (i.e., camel case).

For example, an atlas `schaefer_444_resampled.nii.gz` will become `rois-schaefer444Resampled` in ROI outputs.

## timeseries TSV format

Columns in timeseries files are tab-separated. A header row is included, and `volume` is
one of the variables. The other variables are named `roi<xx>` according to their integer value
in the ROI mask. Here is a short example of such a file:

```
volume  roi1  roi2  roi3
     1  10.2  15.2    NA
     2  10.5  15.1    NA
     3  11.1  15.0    NA
     6  10.4  15.1    NA
     7  10.2  15.5    NA
```

Note how volume skips from 3 to 6. This reflects that volumes 4 and 5 were scrubbed from the output.
`roi3` is all NA because it had fewer than the minimum number of valid voxel time series (default: 5).

## connectivity TSV format

Connectivity matrices are output as tab-separated files. They contain a square correlation matrix with
a header row denoting the corresponding integer value in the ROI mask. Here is a short example:

```
roi1   roi2   roi3
   1    0.7     NA
 0.7      1     NA
  NA     NA      1
```

Here, the correlations of `roi3` with the other ROIs are NA because the time series was NA.

# Summary

`extract_rois()` provides a flexible way to derive ROI signals and functional
connectivity from postprocessed fMRI data. By selecting appropriate reduction
and correlation methods, you can tailor ROI analyses to the needs of your
study.

*Note*: You can technically call `extract_rois()` directly, but this is recommended only for testing because it runs the compute directly within the R session, rather than scheduling jobs on the HPC.

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(BrainGnomes)
extract_rois(
  bold_file = "sub-01_task-rest_desc-clean_bold.nii.gz",
  atlas_files = "Schaefer400.nii.gz",
  out_dir = "data_rois",
  roi_reduce = "mean",
  cor_method = c("pearson", "cor.shrink")
)
```
