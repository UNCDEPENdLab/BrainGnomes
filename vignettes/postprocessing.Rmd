# Overview

This vignette focuses on the **postprocessing** features of the
`BrainGnomes` package. Postprocessing refers to the optional steps that
can be applied *after* fMRIPrep has generated preprocessed BOLD files.
These operations include masking, spatial smoothing, ICA‑AROMA denoising,
scrubbing, temporal filtering, intensity normalisation and confound
handling.  Configuration of these steps occurs via
`setup_project()` when a project is first created or later through
`edit_project()`.

To get started, make sure you have created a project configuration object (here, we will call it `scfg`) using
`setup_project()` or loaded one with `load_project()`.

```r
library(BrainGnomes)
# scfg <- setup_project()  # or load_project("/path/to/project")
```

# Enabling Postprocessing

During `setup_project()` you will be asked whether to enable
postprocessing for BOLD data. You can toggle this choice later with
`edit_project(scfg)`.

```r
scfg <- edit_project(scfg)  # choose "Postprocessing" from the menu
```

Once enabled, each step described below can be configured interactively.

# Postprocessing streams

Postprocessing supports multiple streams, allowing you to postprocess data in multiple ways.
For example, perhaps you'd like to compare results for a 5mm versus 6mm spatial smoothing kernel.

Each stream also asks about which files should be entered into the stream. For example,
files with 'rest' in their name could be postprocessed in one way and files with 'nback' could
be processed a different way.

The menu for setting up postprocessing streams looks like this:

```
Current postprocessing streams:
  (none defined yet)

Modify postprocessing streams: 

1: Add a stream
2: Edit a stream
3: Delete a stream
4: Show stream settings
5: Finish
```

If you choose to add a stream, you will be guided through major decision points.

# Global Options

The first prompts define global postprocessing behavior. You specify
which fMRIPrep outputs to process (`input_regex`), the BIDS description
for final files (`bids_desc`), whether to keep intermediate images, and
if existing outputs should be overwritten.  The TR of your scans and an
optional brain mask file are also collected.

## Selecting BOLD files with `input_regex`

The `input_regex` setting controls which preprocessed NIfTI files are
included. Instead of writing a full regular expression, you may supply
BIDS entity-value pairs that are converted to a regex at runtime. For
example:

```r
desc:preproc task:ridl suffix:bold
```

selects any file containing `task-ridl` and `desc-preproc` with a `bold`
suffix, producing `".*task-ridl(_[^_]+)*_desc-preproc(_[^_]+)*_bold\\.nii(\\.gz)?$"`.

To provide a custom regular expression, prefix it with `regex:`:

```r
regex: .*task-rest.*preproc.*\.nii\.gz$
```

This pattern matches any file containing `task-rest` and ending in
`_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz`. You could create another configuration for
task-based data using a different expression.

## Output naming with `bids_desc`

Every postprocessing stream is also defined by a [BIDS description field](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/derivatives/common-data-types.html#preprocessed-or-cleaned-data).
This field (`bids_desc`) is used to label of every postprocessed for the stream. For example, if the input filename is

```
sub-01_task-rest_run-1_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz
```

and you choose `bids_desc = "clean"`, the output will be named

```
sub-01_task-rest_run-1_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-clean_bold.nii.gz
```

# Individual Processing Steps

After the global settings, the postprocessing menus walk through a sequence of
setup functions for each optional step. You may enable or skip any of
them. Below we summarize the purpose of each step, how to enable it, and
key options the setup functions will prompt for.

## Applying a Brain Mask

`setup_apply_mask()` controls whether to apply a binary brain mask to
all BOLD runs.  The prompt explains the rationale and lets you provide a
mask file and output prefix.

```
Applying a brain mask to your fMRI data ensures that only in-brain voxels are retained during analysis.
This step is optional but often recommended for improving efficiency and accuracy in subsequent processing.
The mask will be applied as a binary filter to the 4D functional data, zeroing out signal outside the brain.
You can specify a custom mask file (in the same space and resolution as your fMRI data), or use the default
mask produced by your preprocessing pipeline.
Do you want to apply a brain mask to your fMRI data?
```

Options include a path to the mask file (`mask_file`) and a prefix for
the masked output (`prefix`, default `"m"`).【F:R/setup_postprocess.R†L496-L544】

## Spatial Smoothing

Spatial smoothing applies a 3D Gaussian kernel to the BOLD fMRI data,
which typically increases the signal-to-noise ratio and improves overlap across subjects
by reducing high-frequency spatial noise.

You will be asked to specify the size of the smoothing kernel in millimeters
(full width at half maximum, or FWHM). Common choices range from 4mm to 8mm.
Smoothing is achieved using FSL's susan command, which applies a nonlinear filtering algorithm
that seeks to smooth together only voxels of similar intensities.
Technical details are [here](https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~steve/susan/susan/node18.html#SECTION00062000000000000000)

## ICA‑AROMA Denoising

For ICA-AROMA denoising to be applied during postprocessing, you must enable it in the project configuration
and it must have been run at some point (i.e., `Run ICA-AROMA?` in `run_project()`). This will produce a set
of output files, including `*_desc-MELODIC_mixing.tsv` (the mixing matrix), which contains the spatiotemporal
components identified both as noise and signal by the algorithm.

When ICA‑AROMA outputs are available, you can regress out the noise components as a postprocessing step.
Building on the original papers (Pruim et al., 2015), we recommend 'nonaggressive' removal, which
only removes the variance in 'noise' components that is not correlated with signal components 
(i.e., partial effects in multiple regression). As detailed below, if AROMA is applied to the fMRI data,
the components will also be regressed out of any confounds.

## Scrubbing High‑Motion Volumes

'Scrubbing' refers to a set of procedures for reducing the impact of high-motion/high-artifact volumes on fMRI analysis.
The most typical approach is to flag volumes based on their framewise displacement, a measure of overall head displacement
in any direction/rotation, and to remove those volumes from the time series. That said, scrubbing encompasses a wider range of
decisions, such as whether to interpolate the bad timepoints and whether to generate spike regressors while leaving the fMRI
data intact (e.g., for subsequent use in task-based analysis). Importantly, scrubbing has tricky
interactions with other postprocessing steps, especially confound regression and temporal filtering.

Temporal filtering removes specific *frequencies* from the data, so we cannot simply delete volumes from the time series
and hope to have the filtering work as intended. Moreover, if we apply the temporal filter prior to scrubbing, we can induce
'ringing artifacts' where large signal changes due to head motion are propagated to adjacent timepoints (Carp, 2012, NeuroImage).
One effective way to handle this is to interpolate over bad volumes (cubic spline is common), then apply the temporal filter, and
later scrub out the bad (now interpolated) timepoints. This is how [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/generated/nilearn.signal.clean.html#nilearn.signal.clean)
and [XCP-D](https://xcp-d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html) approach the problem. BrainGnomes also allows for spline interpolation
as a precursor to temporal filtering.

Another scrubbing interaction occurs with confound regression. If we plan to regress out confound signals from the fMRI, we want to
maximize the denoising for the volumes we ultimately wish to analyze, not the volumes we plan to scrub out. Consequently,
we could either a) run confound regression after scrubbing or b) optimize the fit of the regression model only for good timepoints.
Aligned with XCP-D pipeline, we adopt the latter strategy, fitting the confound model on good timepoints. This allows
for (potentially interpolated) high-motion timepoints to be retained in the final fMRI timeseries. Typically, we would remove/scrub these,
but if your analysis requires intact timeseries (e.g., for a frequency-based analysis), perhaps you'd like to keep all timepoints.

### Setting up scrubbing

If you enable scrubbing, you will be asked to define what constitutes a 'scrubbed' volume. This should be a single logical expression
in R syntax that can be evaluated against the confounds TSV file produced by fmriprep. For example, if you wish to scrub any volume
with more than 0.5mm framewise displacement, the expression would be: `framewise_displacement > 0.5`. You can have logical operators
in the expression, too, allowing something like `framewise_displacement > 0.5 | dvars > 5`.

In addition, your scrubbing expression can specify a range of volumes to scrub using a format like: '-1:1; dvars > 1.5'.
The part before the semicolon (-1:1) defines a temporal window around the bad timepoint. For example, '-1:0'
scrubs the bad timepoint and the volume before it. If omitted, only the bad timepoint (0) is scrubbed.
The part after the semicolon ('dvars > 1.5') defines the thresholding condition.

Next, you will be asked whether you want any 

`setup_scrubbing()` generates spike regressors and optional censoring of
bad time points. The prompts describe how expressions such as
`framewise_displacement > 0.9` mark volumes for removal. You may also
interpolate over these time points or drop them from the final NIfTI
file. The following lines show part of the interactive help text.【F:R/setup_postprocess.R†L389-L475】
This interpolation mirrors the approach used in the xcp-d pipeline,
where censored frames are replaced via cubic splines before further
processing. Filtering and regression then operate on a contiguous time
series, minimising edge artefacts.

## Temporal Filtering

Temporal filtering is common in both task-based and resting-state fMRI analyses. In task
fMRI, we often apply a gentle high-pass filter (e.g. .008 Hz) to remove low-frequency drift
that can weaken GLM analyses that assume a constant baseline. In resting-state analyses,
people often bandpass

configures high‑pass and/or low‑pass cutoffs
and the filtering method (FSL or a Butterworth implementation). Filtering
removes unwanted frequency components such as slow drifts or fast
physiological noise.

The two methods behave slightly differently. The FSL approach calls
`fslmaths -bptf`, which performs Gaussian weighted high‑ and low‑pass
filtering by specifying the cutoffs in volumes (internally converted
from Hz using a FWHM‑to‑sigma formula). This approach yields smooth
roll‑off around the specified frequencies and minimises ringing at the
expense of a somewhat broad transition band. The Butterworth option uses
a digital IIR filter designed with the `signal` package and applied
voxelwise via C++ code. Filtering is applied in a forward and reverse
pass to preserve phase. The Butterworth design allows sharper cutoffs
and explicit control of the filter order, producing a steeper response
than the Gaussian implementation.
The xcp-d developers favour Butterworth filtering for its zero-phase
design and sharper transition bands, though the FSL option remains
compatible with many existing workflows.

## Intensity Normalisation

`setup_intensity_normalization()` rescales each run so that the global
median intensity matches a user‑specified value (default 10,000). This
helps make signal units comparable across subjects.

## Confound Calculation and Regression

Two steps handle confounds. `setup_confound_calculate()` creates a TSV
file of nuisance regressors (motion parameters, CompCor components, DVARS,
global signal, etc.) that may be filtered to match the BOLD data. Columns
to include are selected with patterns that can contain regular expressions
or numeric ranges inside angle brackets. For example
`a_comp_cor_<1-6>` expands to `a_comp_cor_1` through `a_comp_cor_6` and a
pattern like `^trans_` will match all six motion parameters. This expansion
is implemented in `expand_confound_columns()`.【F:R/postprocess_functions.R†L996-L1036】

Standard motion-confound bundles can also be selected using shortcuts such as
`"6p"`, `"12p"`, `"24p"`, or `"36p"` to request common sets of motion
parameters and their derivatives/squared terms.

Filtered confounds (listed in `columns`) undergo the same temporal
filtering as the BOLD data, while unfiltered confounds (listed in
`noproc_columns`) are appended without processing. Typical unfiltered
regressors include binary spike regressors from scrubbing.

Confound selection accepts regular expressions and numeric ranges. For
instance `^trans_` matches all six translational motion parameters and
`a_comp_cor_<1-6>` expands to the first six CompCor components. Both
filtered and unfiltered sets may use these patterns, giving fine-grained
control over nuisance regressors.

`setup_confound_regression()` optionally performs voxelwise regression of
these confounds. If scrubbing is enabled, the censor file written during
`setup_scrubbing()` is passed to the regression step so that model fits are
computed using only volumes marked as “good.”【F:R/postprocess_functions.R†L748-L764】
The residuals are written to new NIfTI files with a chosen prefix.
Because filtered confounds match the exact temporal treatment of the BOLD
data, this regression step is safe from mismatch artifacts, similar to the
strategy described in the xcp-d documentation.

    "6p" = c("rot_x", "rot_y", "rot_z", "trans_x", "trans_y", "trans_z"),
    "12p" = c(
      "rot_x", "rot_x_derivative1", "rot_y", "rot_y_derivative1",
      "rot_z", "rot_z_derivative1", "trans_x", "trans_x_derivative1",
      "trans_y", "trans_y_derivative1", "trans_z", "trans_z_derivative1"
    ),
    "24p" = c(
      "rot_x", "rot_x_derivative1", "rot_x_derivative1_power2", "rot_x_power2",
      "rot_y", "rot_y_derivative1", "rot_y_derivative1_power2", "rot_y_power2",
      "rot_z", "rot_z_derivative1", "rot_z_derivative1_power2", "rot_z_power2",
      "trans_x", "trans_x_derivative1", "trans_x_derivative1_power2", "trans_x_power2",
      "trans_y", "trans_y_derivative1", "trans_y_derivative1_power2", "trans_y_power2",
      "trans_z", "trans_z_derivative1", "trans_z_derivative1_power2", "trans_z_power2"
    ),
    "36p" = c(
      "csf", "csf_derivative1", "csf_derivative1_power2", "csf_power2",
      "global_signal", "global_signal_derivative1", "global_signal_derivative1_power2",
      "global_signal_power2",
      "rot_x", "rot_x_derivative1", "rot_x_derivative1_power2", "rot_x_power2",
      "rot_y", "rot_y_derivative1", "rot_y_derivative1_power2", "rot_y_power2",
      "rot_z", "rot_z_derivative1", "rot_z_derivative1_power2", "rot_z_power2",
      "trans_x", "trans_x_derivative1", "trans_x_derivative1_power2", "trans_x_power2",
      "trans_y", "trans_y_derivative1", "trans_y_derivative1_power2", "trans_y_power2",
      "trans_z", "trans_z_derivative1", "trans_z_derivative1_power2", "trans_z_power2",
      "white_matter", "white_matter_derivative1", "white_matter_derivative1_power2",
      "white_matter_power2"
    )

## Ordering Steps

Finally, `setup_postproc_steps()` determines the order in which enabled
steps run. By default the order is masking, smoothing, AROMA, optional
scrubbing/interpolation, temporal filtering, confound regression, and
intensity normalisation. You may override this order by answering “yes”
to the prompt shown in the code below.【F:R/setup_postprocess.R†L321-L358】

# Running Postprocessing

After configuration, running `run_project()` will execute the selected
postprocessing steps for each subject.

```r
run_project(scfg, steps = "postprocess")
```

The processing log for each subject is written to the project’s `logs`
folder, and the final postprocessed NIfTIs receive the BIDS description
specified earlier.

# Naming and use of intermediate files

During the setup of postprocessing, you will be asked whether to keep intermediate files.
Generally speaking, you should say 'no' since these files only have a subset of postprocessing
steps applied to them (e.g., smoothed, but not temporally filtered). That said, if you'd like to
inspect intermediate stages of processing, you acn 

# Summary

Postprocessing in BrainGnomes is fully configurable. Using
`setup_project()` or `edit_project()` you can enable or disable each
operation, control parameters such as smoothing kernel and filtering
cutoffs, and decide the order in which steps occur. Running the project
then applies these settings consistently across all subjects.

For more details on individual functions see the package documentation
and the help pages referenced above.
