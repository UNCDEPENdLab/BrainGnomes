</h2>
<p>This vignette focuses on the <strong>postprocessing</strong> features
of the <code>BrainGnomes</code> package. Postprocessing refers to the
optional steps that can be applied <em>after</em> fMRIPrep has generated
preprocessed BOLD files. These operations include masking, spatial
smoothing, ICA‑AROMA denoising, scrubbing, temporal filtering, intensity
normalisation and confound handling. Configuration of these steps occurs
via <code><a href="../reference/setup_project.html">setup_project()</a></code> when a project is first created or
later through <code><a href="../reference/edit_project.html">edit_project()</a></code>.</p>
<p>To get started, make sure you have created a project configuration
object (here, we will call it <code>scfg</code>) using
<code><a href="../reference/setup_project.html">setup_project()</a></code> or loaded one with
<code><a href="../reference/load_project.html">load_project()</a></code>.</p>

<p>During <code><a href="../reference/setup_project.html">setup_project()</a></code> you will be asked whether to
enable postprocessing for BOLD data. You can toggle this choice later
with <code>edit_project(scfg)</code>.</p>

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="postprocessing-streams">Postprocessing streams<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#postprocessing-streams"></a>
</h2>
<p>Postprocessing supports multiple streams, allowing you to postprocess
data in multiple ways. For example, perhaps you’d like to compare
results for a 5mm versus 6mm spatial smoothing kernel.</p>
<p>Each stream also asks about which files should be entered into the
stream. For example, files with ‘rest’ in their name could be
postprocessed in one way and files with ‘nback’ could be processed a
different way.</p>
<p>The menu for setting up postprocessing streams looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Current postprocessing streams:
  (none defined yet)

Modify postprocessing streams: 

1: Add a stream
2: Edit a stream
3: Delete a stream
4: Show stream settings
5: Finish</code></pre>
<p>If you choose to add a stream, you will be guided through major
decision points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="global-options">Global Options<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#global-options"></a>
</h2>
<p>The first prompts define global postprocessing behavior. You specify
which fMRIPrep outputs to process (<code>input_regex</code>), the BIDS
description for final files (<code>bids_desc</code>), whether to keep
intermediate images, and if existing outputs should be overwritten. The
TR of your scans and an optional brain mask file are also collected.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="selecting-bold-files-with-input_regex">Selecting BOLD files with <code>input_regex</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#selecting-bold-files-with-input_regex"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>input_regex</code> setting controls which preprocessed
NIfTI files are included. Instead of writing a full regular expression,
you may supply BIDS entity-value pairs that are converted to a regex at
runtime. For example:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" tabindex="-1"></a>desc<span class="sc">:</span>preproc task<span class="sc">:</span>ridl suffix<span class="sc">:</span>bold</span></code></pre></div>
<p>selects any file containing <code>task-ridl</code> and
<code>desc-preproc</code> with a <code>bold</code> suffix, producing
<code>".*task-ridl(_[^_]+)*_desc-preproc(_[^_]+)*_bold\\.nii(\\.gz)?$"</code>.</p>
<p>To provide a custom regular expression, prefix it with
<code>regex:</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" tabindex="-1"></a>regex<span class="sc">:</span> .<span class="sc">*</span>task<span class="sc">-</span>rest.<span class="sc">*</span>preproc.<span class="sc">*</span>\.nii\.gz<span class="sc">$</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This pattern matches any file containing <code>task-rest</code> and
ending in <code>_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz</code>. You could create
another configuration for task-based data using a different
expression.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="output-naming-with-bids_desc">Output naming with <code>bids_desc</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#output-naming-with-bids_desc"></a>

<p>Every postprocessing stream is also defined by a <a href="https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/derivatives/common-data-types.html#preprocessed-or-cleaned-data" class="external-link">BIDS
description field</a>. This field (<code>bids_desc</code>) is used to
label of every postprocessed for the stream. For example, if the input
filename is</p>
<pre><code>sub-01_task-rest_run-1_space-MNI152NLin2009cAsym_desc-preproc_bold.nii.gz</code></pre>
<p>and you choose <code>bids_desc = "clean"</code>, the output will be
named</p>

<h2 id="individual-processing-steps">Individual Processing Steps<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#individual-processing-steps"></a>
</h2>
<p>After the global settings, the postprocessing menus walk through a
sequence of setup functions for each optional step. You may enable or
skip any of them. Below we summarize the purpose of each step, how to
enable it, and key options the setup functions will prompt for.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="applying-a-brain-mask">Applying a Brain Mask<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#applying-a-brain-mask"></a>
</h3>
<p><code><a href="../reference/setup_apply_mask.html">setup_apply_mask()</a></code> controls whether to apply a binary
brain mask to all BOLD runs. The prompt explains the rationale and lets
you provide a mask file and output prefix.</p>
<pre><code>Applying a brain mask to your fMRI data ensures that only in-brain voxels are retained during analysis.
This step is optional but often recommended for improving efficiency and accuracy in subsequent processing.
The mask will be applied as a binary filter to the 4D functional data, zeroing out signal outside the brain.
You can specify a custom mask file (in the same space and resolution as your fMRI data), or use the default
mask produced by your preprocessing pipeline.
Do you want to apply a brain mask to your fMRI data?</code></pre>
<p>Options include a path to the mask file (<code>mask_file</code>) and
a prefix for the masked output (<code>prefix</code>, default
<code>"m"</code>).【F:R/setup_postprocess.R†L496-L544】</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="spatial-smoothing">Spatial Smoothing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#spatial-smoothing"></a>
</h3>
<p>Spatial smoothing applies a 3D Gaussian kernel to the BOLD fMRI data,
which typically increases the signal-to-noise ratio and improves overlap
across subjects by reducing high-frequency spatial noise.</p>
<p>You will be asked to specify the size of the smoothing kernel in
millimeters (full width at half maximum, or FWHM). Common choices range
from 4mm to 8mm. Smoothing is achieved using FSL’s susan command, which
applies a nonlinear filtering algorithm that seeks to smooth together
only voxels of similar intensities. Technical details are <a href="https://users.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/~steve/susan/susan/node18.html#SECTION00062000000000000000" class="external-link">here</a></p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="icaaroma-denoising">ICA‑AROMA Denoising<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#icaaroma-denoising"></a>
</h3>
<p>For ICA-AROMA denoising to be applied during postprocessing, you must
enable it in the project configuration and it must have been run at some
point (i.e., <code>Run ICA-AROMA?</code> in <code><a href="../reference/run_project.html">run_project()</a></code>).
This will produce a set of output files, including
<code>*_desc-MELODIC_mixing.tsv</code> (the mixing matrix), which
contains the spatiotemporal components identified both as noise and
signal by the algorithm.</p>
<p>When ICA‑AROMA outputs are available, you can regress out the noise
components as a postprocessing step. Building on the original papers
(Pruim et al., 2015), we recommend ‘nonaggressive’ removal, which only
removes the variance in ‘noise’ components that is not correlated with
signal components (i.e., partial effects in multiple regression). As
detailed below, if AROMA is applied to the fMRI data, the components
will also be regressed out of any confounds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="scrubbing-highmotion-volumes">Scrubbing High‑Motion Volumes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scrubbing-highmotion-volumes"></a>
</h3>
<p>‘Scrubbing’ refers to a set of procedures for reducing the impact of
high-motion/high-artifact volumes on fMRI analysis. The most typical
approach is to flag volumes based on their framewise displacement, a
measure of overall head displacement in any direction/rotation, and to
remove those volumes from the time series. That said, scrubbing
encompasses a wider range of decisions, such as whether to interpolate
the bad timepoints and whether to generate spike regressors while
leaving the fMRI data intact (e.g., for subsequent use in task-based
analysis). Importantly, scrubbing has tricky interactions with other
postprocessing steps, especially confound regression and temporal
filtering.</p>
<p>Temporal filtering removes specific <em>frequencies</em> from the
data, so we cannot simply delete volumes from the time series and hope
to have the filtering work as intended. Moreover, if we apply the
temporal filter prior to scrubbing, we can induce ‘ringing artifacts’
where large signal changes due to head motion are propagated to adjacent
timepoints (Carp, 2012, NeuroImage). One effective way to handle this is
to interpolate over bad volumes (cubic spline is common), then apply the
temporal filter, and later scrub out the bad (now interpolated)
timepoints. This is how <a href="https://nilearn.github.io/stable/modules/generated/nilearn.signal.clean.html#nilearn.signal.clean" class="external-link">nilearn</a>
and <a href="https://xcp-d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflows.html" class="external-link">XCP-D</a>
approach the problem. BrainGnomes also allows for spline interpolation
as a precursor to temporal filtering.</p>
<p>Another scrubbing interaction occurs with confound regression. If we
plan to regress out confound signals from the fMRI, we want to maximize
the denoising for the volumes we ultimately wish to analyze, not the
volumes we plan to scrub out. Consequently, we could either a) run
confound regression after scrubbing or b) optimize the fit of the
regression model only for good timepoints. Aligned with XCP-D pipeline,
we adopt the latter strategy, fitting the confound model on good
timepoints. This allows for (potentially interpolated) high-motion
timepoints to be retained in the final fMRI timeseries. Typically, we
would remove/scrub these, but if your analysis requires intact
timeseries (e.g., for a frequency-based analysis), perhaps you’d like to
keep all timepoints.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="setting-up-scrubbing">Setting up scrubbing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#setting-up-scrubbing"></a>
</h4>
<p>If you enable scrubbing, you will be asked to define what constitutes
a ‘scrubbed’ volume. This should be a single logical expression in R
syntax that can be evaluated against the confounds TSV file produced by
fmriprep. For example, if you wish to scrub any volume with more than
0.5mm framewise displacement, the expression would be:
<code>framewise_displacement &gt; 0.5</code>. You can have logical
operators in the expression, too, allowing something like
<code>framewise_displacement &gt; 0.5 | dvars &gt; 5</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, your scrubbing expression can specify a range of volumes
to scrub using a format like: ‘-1:1; dvars &gt; 1.5’. The part before
the semicolon (-1:1) defines a temporal window around the bad timepoint.
For example, ‘-1:0’ scrubs the bad timepoint and the volume before it.
If omitted, only the bad timepoint (0) is scrubbed. The part after the
semicolon (‘dvars &gt; 1.5’) defines the thresholding condition.</p>
<p>Next, you will be asked whether you want any</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/setup_scrubbing.html">setup_scrubbing()</a></code> generates spike regressors and
optional censoring of bad time points. The prompts describe how
expressions such as <code>framewise_displacement &gt; 0.9</code> mark
volumes for removal. You may also interpolate over these time points or
drop them from the final NIfTI file. The following lines show part of
the interactive help text.【F:R/setup_postprocess.R†L389-L475】 This
interpolation mirrors the approach used in the xcp-d pipeline, where
censored frames are replaced via cubic splines before further
processing. Filtering and regression then operate on a contiguous time
series, minimising edge artefacts.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="temporal-filtering">Temporal Filtering<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#temporal-filtering"></a>
</h3>
<p>Temporal filtering is common in both task-based and resting-state
fMRI analyses. In task fMRI, we often apply a gentle high-pass filter
(e.g. .008 Hz) to remove low-frequency drift that can weaken GLM
analyses that assume a constant baseline. In resting-state analyses,
people often bandpass</p>
<p>configures high‑pass and/or low‑pass cutoffs and the filtering method
(FSL or a Butterworth implementation). Filtering removes unwanted
frequency components such as slow drifts or fast physiological
noise.</p>
<p>The two methods behave slightly differently. The FSL approach calls
<code>fslmaths -bptf</code>, which performs Gaussian weighted high‑ and
low‑pass filtering by specifying the cutoffs in volumes (internally
converted from Hz using a FWHM‑to‑sigma formula). This approach yields
smooth roll‑off around the specified frequencies and minimises ringing
at the expense of a somewhat broad transition band. The Butterworth
option uses a digital IIR filter designed with the <code>signal</code>
package and applied voxelwise via C++ code. Filtering is applied in a
forward and reverse pass to preserve phase. The Butterworth design
allows sharper cutoffs and explicit control of the filter order,
producing a steeper response than the Gaussian implementation. The xcp-d
developers favour Butterworth filtering for its zero-phase design and
sharper transition bands, though the FSL option remains compatible with
many existing workflows.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="intensity-normalisation">Intensity Normalisation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intensity-normalisation"></a>
</h3>
<p><code><a href="../reference/setup_intensity_normalization.html">setup_intensity_normalization()</a></code> rescales each run so
that the global median intensity matches a user‑specified value (default
10,000). This helps make signal units comparable across subjects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="confound-calculation-and-regression">Confound Calculation and Regression<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#confound-calculation-and-regression"></a>
</h3>
<p>Two steps handle confounds. <code><a href="../reference/setup_confound_calculate.html">setup_confound_calculate()</a></code>
creates a TSV file of nuisance regressors (motion parameters, CompCor
components, DVARS, global signal, etc.) that may be filtered to match
the BOLD data. Columns to include are selected with patterns that can
contain regular expressions or numeric ranges inside angle brackets. For
example <code>a_comp_cor_&lt;1-6&gt;</code> expands to
<code>a_comp_cor_1</code> through <code>a_comp_cor_6</code> and a
pattern like <code>^trans_</code> will match all six motion parameters.
This expansion is implemented in
<code>expand_confound_columns()</code>.【F:R/postprocess_functions.R†L996-L1036】</p>
<p>Standard motion-confound bundles can also be selected using shortcuts
such as <code>"6p"</code>, <code>"12p"</code>, <code>"24p"</code>, or
<code>"36p"</code> to request common sets of motion parameters and their
derivatives/squared terms.</p>
<p>Filtered confounds (listed in <code>columns</code>) undergo the same
temporal filtering as the BOLD data, while unfiltered confounds (listed
in <code>noproc_columns</code>) are appended without processing. Typical
unfiltered regressors include binary spike regressors from
scrubbing.</p>
<p>Confound selection accepts regular expressions and numeric ranges.
For instance <code>^trans_</code> matches all six translational motion
parameters and <code>a_comp_cor_&lt;1-6&gt;</code> expands to the first
six CompCor components. Both filtered and unfiltered sets may use these
patterns, giving fine-grained control over nuisance regressors.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/setup_confound_regression.html">setup_confound_regression()</a></code> optionally performs
voxelwise regression of these confounds. If scrubbing is enabled, the
censor file written during <code><a href="../reference/setup_scrubbing.html">setup_scrubbing()</a></code> is passed to
the regression step so that model fits are computed using only volumes
marked as “good.”【F:R/postprocess_functions.R†L748-L764】 The residuals
are written to new NIfTI files with a chosen prefix. Because filtered
confounds match the exact temporal treatment of the BOLD data, this
regression step is safe from mismatch artifacts, similar to the strategy
described in the xcp-d documentation.</p>
