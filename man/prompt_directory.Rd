\description{
Prompts the user for a directory path. If it exists, optionally checks:
\itemize{
\item ownership (check_owner)
\item readability (check_readable; can try make_readable if owned)
\item writability (check_writeable; can try make_writeable if owned)
Any remaining issues are combined into a single proceed prompt.
