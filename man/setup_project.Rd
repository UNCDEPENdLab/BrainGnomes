\usage{
setup_project(input = NULL, fields = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{A \code{bg_project_cfg} object, a path to a YAML file, or a project
directory containing \code{project_config.yaml}. If a directory is supplied
but the file is missing, \code{setup_project} starts from an empty list with
a warning. For \code{setup_project} only, this argument may also be
\code{NULL} to create a new configuration from scratch.}

\item{fields}{A character vector of fields to be prompted for. If \code{NULL}, all fields will be prompted for.}
}
\value{
A \code{bg_project_cfg} list containing the project configuration. New fields are added based on user input,
and missing entries are filled with defaults. The configuration is written
to \code{project_config.yaml} in the project directory unless the user declines
to overwrite an existing file.
