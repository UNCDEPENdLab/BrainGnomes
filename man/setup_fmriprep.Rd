\title{Configure fMRIPrep preprocessing settings}
\usage{
setup_fmriprep(scfg = NULL, fields = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scfg}{A project configuration object, as produced by \code{load_project()} or \code{setup_project()}.}

\item{fields}{A character vector of fields to be prompted for. If \code{NULL}, all fMRIPrep fields will be prompted for.}
}
\value{
A modified version of \code{scfg} with the \verb{$fmriprep} entry populated.
}
\description{
This function sets up fMRIPrep job configuration, including scheduling and resource parameters,
output specifications, and the location of required files such as the FreeSurfer license.
It prompts the user interactively (or selectively if \code{fields} is supplied) and modifies the
project configuration list (\code{scfg}) to include settings for running fMRIPrep.
}
\details{
fMRIPrep is a robust and standardized preprocessing pipeline for BOLD and structural MRI data
organized according to the BIDS standard. It performs motion correction, susceptibility distortion
correction, brain extraction, spatial normalization, confound estimation, and other key steps
to prepare fMRI data for statistical analysis.

This function allows you to specify memory, number of cores, and maximum runtime for fMRIPrep jobs,
as well as fMRIPrep-specific options such as output spaces and the FreeSurfer license file location.
