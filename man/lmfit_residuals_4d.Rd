\title{Apply Confound Regression to 4D fMRI Data Using Voxelwise Linear Models}
\arguments{
\item{infile}{Path to a 4D NIfTI image file to denoise (e.g., functional data).}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows correspond to timepoints and columns to nuisance regressors.
Typically includes motion parameters, physiological noise, etc.}

\item{include_rows}{Logical vector indicating which timepoints to include in model fitting (e.g., uncensored).
Must be the same length as the number of timepoints in the image and the number of rows in \code{X}.}

\item{add_intercept}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adds an intercept column to the design matrix unless one is already present.}

\item{outfile}{Optional path to write the output residuals image. If empty, no file is written.}

\item{internal}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, returns an internal RNifti pointer. Otherwise returns an R array.}

\item{preserve_mean}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, constant time series will be left unchanged (not demeaned or recentered).}

\item{set_mean}{Optional numeric value; if specified, all residual time series will be shifted to have this mean
(default is 0). Cannot be used in combination with \code{preserve_mean = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A residualized 4D NIfTI image, either as an in-memory array or RNifti object (if \code{internal = TRUE}).
}
\description{
This function performs voxelwise confound regression by fitting a linear model to a subset of timepoints
(e.g., uncensored volumes) for each voxel in a 4D NIfTI image. The fitted model is then applied to all
timepoints to obtain predicted values, and the residuals are returned as a cleaned 4D image.
}
\details{
This approach mirrors the strategy used in the XCP-D pipeline, where nuisance regressors are fit only
to valid (non-censored) timepoints to prevent bias, but the resulting model is applied to the full
dataset including censored timepoints (e.g., for continuity or interpolation).

Constant columns in the design matrix are automatically removed. If an intercept column (all ones) is present,
it is preserved; otherwise, an intercept will be added if \code{add_intercept = TRUE}.
