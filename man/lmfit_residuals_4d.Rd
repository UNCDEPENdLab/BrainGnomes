\title{Apply Confound Regression to 4D fMRI Data Using Voxelwise Linear Models}
\arguments{
\item{infile}{Path to a 4D NIfTI image file to denoise (e.g., functional data).}

\item{X}{A numeric matrix where rows correspond to timepoints and columns to nuisance regressors.
Typically includes motion parameters, physiological noise, etc.}

\item{include_rows}{Optional logical vector identifying the timepoints used when estimating the model
(e.g., uncensored volumes). If supplied it must have length \code{nrow(X)}; when \code{NULL}, all timepoints are used.}

\item{add_intercept}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adds an intercept column to the design matrix unless one is already present.}

\item{outfile}{Optional path to write the output residuals image. If empty, no file is written.}

\item{internal}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, returns an internal RNifti pointer. Otherwise returns an R array.}

\item{preserve_mean}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, constant time series will be left unchanged (not demeaned or recentered).}

\item{set_mean}{Optional numeric value; if specified, all residual time series will be shifted to have this mean
(default is 0). Cannot be used in combination with \code{preserve_mean = TRUE}.}

\item{regress_cols}{Optional integer vector (1-based) indicating which columns of \code{X} should be regressed out.
When omitted, all non-constant columns are removed unless \code{exclusive = TRUE}.}

\item{exclusive}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, only the columns listed in \code{regress_cols} (and an intercept, if present)
are used to estimate the model. This allows for partial regression that preserves other effects.}
}
\value{
A residualized 4D NIfTI image, either as an in-memory array or RNifti object (if \code{internal = TRUE}).
}
\description{
This function performs voxelwise confound regression by fitting a linear model to a subset of timepoints
(e.g., uncensored volumes) for each voxel in a 4D NIfTI image. The fitted model is then applied to all
timepoints to obtain predicted values, and the residuals are returned as a cleaned 4D image.
}
\details{
This approach mirrors the strategy used in the XCP-D pipeline, where nuisance regressors are fit only
to valid (non-censored) timepoints to prevent bias, but the resulting model is applied to the full
dataset including censored timepoints (e.g., for continuity or interpolation).

Constant columns in the design matrix are automatically removed. If an intercept column (all ones) is present,
it is preserved. If \code{add_intercept = TRUE}, an intercept column will be added (if not present).
