\usage{
setup_project_directories(scfg, check_cache = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scfg}{A project configuration object.}

\item{check_cache}{Optional environment used to memoize write-permission
results. Directories verified writable here will be recorded so that
downstream preflight checks (e.g. in \code{collect_submit_permission_issues})
can skip redundant \code{file.access()} calls.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{scfg}.
}
\description{
Given a project configuration, create any missing directories referenced in
the metadata, including the project root and standard subdirectories. A
message is emitted for each directory created, and existing but unreadable
directories trigger a warning. After creation, every directory is verified
writable; for directories owned by the current user an attempt is made to
add the user-write bit via \code{ensure_user_writable}.
