\usage{
run_project(
  scfg,
  steps = NULL,
  subject_filter = NULL,
  postprocess_streams = NULL,
  debug = FALSE,
  force = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scfg}{A list containing the study configuration.}

\item{steps}{Character vector of pipeline steps to execute (or \code{"all"} to run all steps).
Options are c("bids_conversion", "mriqc", "fmriprep", "aroma", "postprocess").
If \code{NULL}, the user will be prompted for which steps to run.}

\item{subject_filter}{Optional character vector or data.frame specifying which
subjects (and optionally sessions) to process. When \code{NULL} and run
interactively, the user will be prompted to enter space-separated subject
IDs (press ENTER to process all subjects). When a data.frame is provided, it
must contain a \code{sub_id} column and may include a \code{ses_id} column to filter
on specific subject/session combinations.}

\item{postprocess_streams}{Optional character vector specifying which postprocessing streams should be run. If
\verb{"postprocess"`` is included in }steps`, then this setting lets the user choose streams. If NULL, all postprocess
streams will be run.}

\item{debug}{A logical value indicating whether to run in debug mode (verbose output for debugging, no true processing).}

\item{force}{A logical value indicating whether to force the execution of all steps, regardless of their current status.}
}
\value{
A logical value indicating whether the processing pipeline was successfully run.
