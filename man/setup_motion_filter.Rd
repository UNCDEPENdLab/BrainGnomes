\description{
If motion parameters are used in scrubbing expressions or included among the
selected confound regressors, users can choose to apply a notch (band-stop)
filter to the rigid-body motion time series prior to downstream processing.
This mirrors the respiration filtering strategy used in tools such as xcp-d
and helps mitigate respiration-induced spikes in framewise displacement.
