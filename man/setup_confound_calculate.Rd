\title{Configure confound calculation for postprocessing}
\usage{
setup_confound_calculate(scfg = list(), fields = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scfg}{A study configuration object created by \code{setup_project()}.}

\item{fields}{A character vector of fields to prompt for. If \code{NULL}, all relevant fields will be prompted.}
}
\value{
A modified version of \code{scfg} with the \verb{$postprocess$confound_calculate} entry updated.
}
\description{
This function configures the generation of a confound file during postprocessing. The resulting file includes
nuisance regressors (e.g., motion parameters, CompCor components, DVARS, global signal) that may be used during
task-based modeling to account for noise without directly altering the fMRI data.
}
\details{
Confounds can be filtered (e.g., with the same temporal filter as applied to fMRI data) or left unfiltered.
Filtered regressors should typically include continuous-valued signals (e.g., a_comp_cor_\emph{, global signal), while
spike regressors or discrete values (e.g., motion_outlier}) should not be filtered.

This function only generates the confound regressors file. Actual regression is handled separately.
