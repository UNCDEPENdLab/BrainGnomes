\usage{
extract_rois(
  bold_file,
  atlas_files,
  out_dir,
  cor_method = c("pearson", "spearman", "kendall", "cor.shrink", "none"),
  roi_reduce = c("mean", "median", "pca", "huber"),

}
\arguments{
\item{bold_file}{Path to a 4D NIfTI file containing postprocessed BOLD data.}

\item{atlas_files}{Character vector of atlas NIfTI files with integer
ROI labels.}

\item{out_dir}{Directory where output files should be written.}

\item{cor_method}{Correlation method(s) to use when computing functional
connectivity. Supported options include "pearson", "spearman",
"kendall", and "cor.shrink". Use "none" to skip correlation
computation. Multiple methods may be supplied.}

\item{roi_reduce}{Method used to summarize voxel time series within each
ROI. Options are "mean" (default), "median", "pca", or "huber".}

\item{brain_mask}{Optional brain mask NIfTI file. If \code{NULL}, a mask
is generated by excluding voxels with zero variance across time.}
}
\value{
A named list. Each element corresponds to an atlas and contains
paths to the written timeseries (\code{timeseries}) and correlation
matrix (\code{correlation}, or \code{NULL} if not computed).
}
\description{
Given a postprocessed BOLD NIfTI file and one or more atlas images,
this function computes the mean timeseries within each ROI and
optionally computes ROI-to-ROI correlation matrices.
}
\details{
Voxels labelled in the atlas but lying outside the brain are
automatically excluded by intersecting with a brain mask derived from
the input timeseries.
