\title{Postprocess a single fMRI BOLD image using a configured pipeline}
\usage{
postprocess_subject(in_file, cfg = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{in_file}{Path to a subject-level BOLD NIfTI file output by fMRIPrep.}

\item{cfg}{A list containing configuration options, including TR (\code{cfg$tr}), enabled processing steps (\verb{cfg$<step>$enable}),
logging (\code{cfg$log_file}), and paths to resources such as brain masks or singularity images (\code{cfg$fsl_img}, \code{cfg$brain_mask}).}
}
\value{
The path to the final postprocessed BOLD NIfTI file. Side effects include writing a confounds TSV file (if enabled),
and logging to a subject-level log file.
}
\description{
Applies a sequence of postprocessing operations to a single subject-level BOLD NIfTI file, as specified by
the user-defined configuration object. Operations may include brain masking, spatial smoothing, ICA-AROMA denoising,
temporal filtering, confound regression, and intensity normalization. The function also optionally computes and saves
a filtered confounds file for downstream analyses.
}
\details{
The processing sequence can be enforced by the user (\code{force_processing_order = TRUE}) or determined dynamically based
on the \code{enable} flags in the configuration. Intermediate NIfTI and confound files may be deleted to save disk space,
depending on the \code{keep_intermediates} setting. Logging is handled via the \code{lgr} package and is directed to subject-specific
log files inferred from BIDS metadata.

Required \code{cfg} entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{tr}: Repetition time in seconds.
\item \code{bids_desc}: A BIDS-compliant \code{desc} label for the output filename.
\item \code{processing_steps}: Optional character vector specifying processing order (if \code{force_processing_order = TRUE}).
}

Optional steps controlled by \verb{cfg$<step>$enable}:
\itemize{
\item \code{apply_mask}
\item \code{spatial_smooth}
\item \code{apply_aroma}
\item \code{temporal_filter}
\item \code{confound_regression}
\item \code{intensity_normalize}
}
}
