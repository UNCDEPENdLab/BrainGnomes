}
\arguments{
\item{scfg}{A project configuration object created by \code{setup_project()}.}

\item{fields}{A character vector of metadata fields to prompt for (e.g., \code{"metadata/project_name"}).

\description{
Prompts the user to configure essential metadata fields for a study-level configuration object.
This includes directories for DICOM inputs, BIDS-formatted outputs, fMRIPrep outputs, MRIQC reports,
TemplateFlow cache, and scratch space for intermediate files. It also ensures required directories
exist or offers to create them interactively.
}
\details{
The function is designed to be used during initial study setup, but can also be used later to fill in
missing metadata or revise selected fields. If specific \code{fields} are provided, only those fields will be prompted.
