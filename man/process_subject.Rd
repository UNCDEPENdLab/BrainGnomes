\item{steps}{A named logical vector indicating which steps to run}

\item{postprocess_streams}{Optional character vector of postprocess configuration names to run. If NULL,
all available streams will be run.}

\item{parent_ids}{An optional character vector of HPC job ids that must complete before this subject is run.}

\item{sequence_id}{An identifying ID for a set of jobs in a sequence used for job tracking}

\item{permission_check_cache}{Optional environment used to memoize write-permission checks
across repeated submissions.}
}
\value{
A logical value indicating whether the preprocessing was successful

\description{
Preprocess a single subject
}
\details{
When postprocessing is requested without running \code{fmriprep}, the function verifies
that the expected fMRIPrep outputs exist. If the configured fMRIPrep directory lies
outside the project directory, only the existence of the subject's directory is
required. For fMRIPrep directories inside the project directory, a \code{.complete}
file in the project's log directory is still necessary.
