# BrainGnomes 0.7-1

* Clarified low_pass_hz and high_pass_hz settings in temporal filtering (postprocessing)

# BrainGnomes 0.7

Released 2025-09-16

* Tested and vetted flywheel sync
* Defer subject processing loop when flywheel sync is the first step
* validate_project adds argument correct_problems to prompt user for corrections if requested
* run_project does not continue if no steps are requested
* check that the scratch_directory is writable when the project is loaded and prompt for a new directory if not
* bugfix: validate_project does not return a top-level 'gap' for postprocess when config is valid
* bugfix: edit_project allows enable/disable modifications
* bugfix: edit_project looks for missing config settings when enabling a previously disabled step
* bugfix: do not display postproc or extract menus when filling in configuration gaps

# BrainGnomes 0.6-1

Released 2025-09-04

* Added Rcpp automask function, mimicking AFNI 3dAutomask.
* Use automask to get approximate whole-brain mask for image quantiles in postprocessing (spatial_smooth, intensity_normalize)
* Use the user-specific mask file in apply_mask, if relevant
* Added prompt_directory, which asks for confirmation when user specifies a non-existent directory
* Support use of AROMA in postproc for outputs generated by fmriprep 23 and before

# BrainGnomes 0.6

Released 2025-08-30

* Added ROI extraction workflow (`extract_rois`) with correlation options and a dedicated vignette.
* Introduced a Flywheel synchronization step for retrieving data.
* Added support for external BIDS and fMRIPrep directories,
  including an `is_external_path` helper, path normalization, and configurable `postproc_directory`.
* Enhanced postprocessing: new `output_dir` argument, direct output movement without symlinks,
  robust file handling, and optional AROMA cleanup with safety checks for MNI res-2 outputs.
* Refined project setup and validation by verifying directories before saving,
  prompting for required containers, and allowing projects to run without a postprocessing directory.
* Documentation and test improvements, including an expanded quickstart guide and instructions for building the FSL container.
